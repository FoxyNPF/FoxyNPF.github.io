Impacket is a collection of Python scripts that can be used by an attacker to target Windows network protocols. This tool can be used to enumerate users, capture hashes, move laterally and escalate privileges. Impacket has also been used by APT groups, in particular Wizard Spider and Stone Panda.

This blog post contains the syntax for running a large number of the Impacket scripts and also the logs that are generated on the target machines.

The Impacket scripts were tested against a Windows 10 machine, any artefacts left behind are included in this report.

## Remote Code Execution:

### psexec.py

psexec.py offers psexec like functionality. This can be used to move laterally with captured credentials or via pass the hash attacks.

![impacket](/impscreenshots/psexecpy.PNG)

Randomly named generated executable uploaded to C:\\Windows. 

Example in above image is named ‘uxVplUAF.exe’

``Md5 - 6983f7001de10f4d19fc2d794c3eb534``

Executable deleted when shell session closed.

Multiple  ‘Logon’ and ‘Special Logon’ Event ID’s generated in Windows Security logs.

``Special Logon - 4672``  
``Logon – 4624``  

![impacket](/impscreenshots/psexecpyseclog.PNG)

Windows System logs contains correlated event for ‘Service Control Manager’.

``Service Control Manager – 7045``  

![impacket](/impscreenshots/psexecpysyslog1.png)

Event ID 7045 will contain the name of the executable uploaded by psexec.py and the running service that was started.

``Service Control Manager – 7045``

![impacket](/impscreenshots/smbexecsyslog.PNG)

Event ID 7045 contains the name of the running service that was started.

The Service File Name will contain command which executes a bat file from the %TEMP% directory and then deletes the file from disk. Bat file contains command executed from remote machine.

![impacket](/impscreenshots/wmiexecpy.PNG)

Multiple  ‘Logon’ and ‘Special Logon’ Event ID’s generated in Windows Security logs.

``Special Logon - 4672``  
``Logon – 4624``

![impacket](/impscreenshots/wmiexecpdot.PNG)

### dcomexec.py

A semi-interactive shell like wmiexec.py but using different DCOM endpoints. Currently supports MMC20.Application, ShellWindows and ShellBrowserWindow objects.

![impacket](/impscreenshots/dcomexecpy.PNG)

Multiple  ‘Logon’ and ‘Special Logon’ Event ID’s generated in Windows Security logs.

## Kerberos:

### GetUserSPNs.py

This script will try to find and fetch Service Principal Names that are associated with normal user accounts. Output is compatible with John the Ripper and HashCat.

![impacket](/impscreenshots/getuserspnspy.PNG)

Windows Security event logs:

``Credential Validation – 4776``  
``Logon – 4624``  
``Kerberos Authentication Service – 4768``  
``Kerberos Service Ticket Operations – 4769``  
``Logoff – 4634``  

![impacket](/impscreenshots/getuserspnsseclog.PNG)

## Windows Secrets:

### secretsdump.py

Performs various techniques to dump secrets from the remote machine without executing any agent. For SAM and LSA Secrets (including cached creds) the tool will try to read as much info as possible from the registry, then save the hives in the target system (%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp directory) and then read the rest of the data from this location. For DIT files, it will dump NTLM hashes, Plaintext credentials (if available) and Kerberos keys using the DL_DRSGetNCChanges() method. It can also dump NTDS.dit via vssadmin executed with the smbexec/wmiexec approach. The script initiates the services required for its working if they are not available (e.g. Remote Registry, even if it is disabled).

![impacket](/impscreenshots/secretsdump.PNG)

Six events generated in Windows Security Logs.

``Special Logon - 4672``

## Server Tools/MiTM Attacks:

### ntlmrelayx.py

This script performs NTLM Relay Attacks, setting an SMB and HTTP Server and relaying credentials to many different protocols (SMB, HTTP, MSSQL, LDAP, IMAP, POP3, etc.). The script can be used with predefined attacks that can be triggered when a connection is relayed (e.g. create a user through LDAP) or can be executed in SOCKS mode. 

Events below generated from SMB Relay Attack; SAM hashes dumped using ntlmrelayx.py.

Eight events generated in Windows Security Logs.
