My YouTube channel is now up and running, if you're looking to go from a malware noob to ninja then be sure to check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCnZXAoXRb6GDLjuFo0dmIg?view_as=subscriber)

I have a tonne of content planned that will take you all the way from the basics such as setting up a lab and analsying word documents, all the way to unpacking and analysing malware in a debugger.

Over the past 6 years I have gone from a total cyber security noob in a SOC to working in 3rd line teams that requires me to analyse malware and be the 'technical guy' on incidents, so I know how daunting it can be to get your head around things like stack memory. 

My plan with the YouTube content is too explain malware analysis in a simple and easy way!
