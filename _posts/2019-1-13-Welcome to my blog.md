I’ve put together this blog for anybody who has an interest in Malware and what goes along with it. In my current role I do a lot of Malware analysis and thought it would be cool to share this with the security community.

My plan is to update this blog regularly with reports on any malware that I have actively seen in the wild and feedback the steps taken in my analysis and also the relevant IOC’s.
