I recently came across the following sample and thought I would share the steps taken to extract the IOC's.

Before opening the document I had the following programs running:

Process Monitor – Filter set to show “Process Create”
Process Hacker
Burp Suite

When I open the document I can see from procmon that the process EQNEDT32.EXE has been launched:

![Procmon](/images/remcos/remcos_ph.png)

As there is no macros to enable this indicates that the malicious Excel document is exploiting the vulnerability in Microsoft’s Equation Editor (CVE-2017-11882) in order to download the binary.

The process associated with Equation editor is then creating a new process:

PID: 3180, Command line: C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\swsx-audio.exe

I have used Burp Suite to proxy the traffic and can see the C2 that was called by the document:

hxxp://aervoes.com/css/viccx[.]exe

![Burp](/images/remcos/burp.png)

The payload is downloaded to the victim machine and from process hacker or process monitor we can see the original name of viccx.exe from burp  has been renamed to swsx-audio.exe.

From process hacker we can now right click the process we have identified and open the location where it has been written to disk:

C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\swsx-audio.exe
MD5 Hash of file - f064826cb414957032c0fbba66a26fb5

In process hacker we can also view the strings of the process running in memory.

![strings](/images/remcos/remcos.png)

Here we can see the type of malware has now been identified as Remcos. There is also a filepath referencing a logs.dat along, reference to a keylogger along with a couple of C2’s.

By navigating to the location in Windows Explorer and opening the file with Notepad we can confirm that the malware is logging the users keystrokes:
