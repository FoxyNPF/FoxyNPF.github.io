PowerSploit is a collection of PowerShell modules which each contain a unique set of scripts that can be used in multiple phases of an attack. 

## PowerSploit

https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit

Once downloaded PowerSploit can be installed by copying or moving the module folders to the following location:

``$Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules``

Alternatively, PowerSploit is installed on Kali Linux by default. When running Kali Linux on the same subnet the scripts can be transferred  to the target Windows machine by setting up a python http server.

**Figure 1 – Kali Linux PowerSploit location**

The following modules makeup the PowerSploit framework:

•	AntivirusBypass  
•	CodeExecution  
•	Exfiltration  
•	Mayhem  
•	Persistence  
•	Privesc  
•	Recon  
•	ScriptModification  

This report will cover how to use some of the modules and include any evidence left behind by running the PowerSploit scripts.

I also want to give a shout out to to Lee Allen who has a great PowerSploit course on pluralsight.com which is worth checking out.

## Recon Module:

The recon module can be used by an attacker to enumerate information about the domain that the compromised device is on.

### Get-Domain

Retrieves information about the current domain.

**Figure 2 – Output of Get-Domain**

![PowerSploit](/images/powerscreens/getdomain.PNG)

No logs generated from running this command.


### Get-DomainController

Retrieves information on the Domain Controller such as hostname and ip address. Additional argument used in the example below specifying domain identified from running the Get-Domain command.

### Get-DomainUser

This script is used to return information on a specific domain user account. The example below shows how it is possible to return information such as the last time the user account logged on, account expiry date and when the password was last set.

The above events are similar to the logs in the previous examples so screenshots have not been provided.


## CodeExecution Module:

The CodeExecution module will allow an attacker to run malicious code on the victim machine. This code can be a payload generated by an attacker and then imported into the running PowerShell process or into a legitimate Windows process.

### Invoke-DllInjection

This script allows an attacker to inject a DLL into a process ID of their choice or the current running PowerShell process.

In this example a malicious x64 dll was created using msfvenom. The following example shows the syntax used to create the DLL which will be used to create a reverse TCP meterpreter shell over port 4444.

**Figure 8 – Syntax for creating malicious DLL in msfvenom**

![PowerSploit](/images/powerscreens/msfvenomdll.PNG)

**Figure 9 – Listener setup on attacker machine**

![PowerSploit](/images/powerscreens/msfvenomdll1.PNG)

The running processes on the victim machine were enumerated to identify the pid of the target process. For purposes of this example notepad has been set as a scheduled task to run as the user ‘system’. The pid of notepad that has been targeted is 2724.

**Figure 10 – Target process enumerated on victim machine**

![PowerSploit](/images/powerscreens/dllps1.png)

Payload generated by msfvenom was then copied to root of C: on victim machine and the command Invoke-DllInjection was executed, this was passed the argument of the process ID and the location of the malicious DLL.

**Figure 15 - Running Processes**

Rundll32.exe is generated as a child process of notepad.exe once the DLL is injected and the reverse shell successfully connects back to the attacker machine. It may be possible to create a threat hunt using this information by focusing on any running processes of rundll32.exe and enumerate parent processes.

Due to the small number of log events generated from this activity a memory dump of the machine was taken. The memory dump was then analysed using Volatility.

https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/

Evidence of the malicious dll was found by dumping the DLL’s from pid 2724, the last entry shows evidence of the malicious DLL. When using this technique look for any DLL’s that are running from unexpected locations.

The output was generated using the following syntax in Volatility:

``vol.py -f <memdump> --profile <profile> dlllist -p <pid>``

**Figure 16 – Output of Volatility dlllist module**

![PowerSploit](/images/powerscreens/invokedllvol1.png)

In a real threat hunt or incident this DLL could then be dumped using Volatility and analysed for further IOC’s.


### Invoke-Shellcode

This script allows an attacker to inject shellcode into a process ID of their choice.

In this example shellcode was generated using msfvenom to create a meterpreter reverse https shell.

## Persistence Module:

Used by an attacker to maintain a foothold on a compromised machine after a reboot.

### Add-Persistence

This script allows an attacker to set a scheduled task to run their payload of choice.

**Figure 23 - Reverse TCP PowerShell payload created using msfvenom**

![PowerSploit](/images/powerscreens/persistencepayload.PNG)

**Figure 24 - Listener setup on attacker machine**

![PowerSploit](/images/powerscreens/persistlistener.PNG)

Payload generated by msfvenom was then copied to victim machine.

Two variables declared, $user and $elevate. These contained the syntax for when the scheduled task was set to run.

The Add-Persistence script was then executed and passed the arguments of the payload location and the previously declared variables.

This then created the ‘Persistence.ps1’ and ‘RemovePersistence.ps1’ scripts.

Executing the Persistence.ps1 script created a scheduled task named ‘Updater’.
