I've worked in Cyber Security for around 5 years for two major UK Telcos.

The majority of this time has been in 3rd line/CERT type roles as an escalation point for high level incidents.

My current role involves a lot of malware analysis and where possible I will be sharing this research on here in that hope that it is of use and or interest to the wider community.
