I've worked in Cyber Security for around 5 years for 2 major UK Telcos and it's a role I really get a lot of enjoyment out of.
The majority of this time has been in 3rd line/CERT type roles as an escalation point for high level incidents.
My current role involves a lot of malware analysis, the reason i setup this blog is I thought it would be good to share some information
with the wider community.
